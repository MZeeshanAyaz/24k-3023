Q1....Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

Ask the user to enter n
Ask the user to enter Nth divisor
SET divide the n number with Nth number(n/Nth)
If the remainder is zero then Nth number is the divisor of n number otherwise if remainder is not zero then Nth number is not the divisor of n number 
If n number %2 and its remainder is equals to 0 display the even number otherwise odd number
